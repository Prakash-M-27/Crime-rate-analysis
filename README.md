🧠 Project Title: Crime Rate Analysis (State-wise)
🎯 SDG Goal:
       SDG 16 – Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions
       Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies through transparent analysis of state-level crime data.

📘 Project Description
         This project focuses on analyzing crime statistics across Indian states using official NCRB data. It identifies trends, hotspots, and correlations between different crime types and population levels. The goal is to visualize and interpret crime patterns effectively, supporting better understanding and policy decisions for a safer society.
   The system automatically processes data, calculates crime rates, and generates insightful visualizations and dashboards that represent crime intensity, category distribution, and population impact.
